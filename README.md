# MLOps Assignment 2 — DistilBERT Goodreads Genre Classifier

**Student:** Shrikrishna Tripathi 

**Roll Number:** G25AIT2103

---

## Overview

This project fine-tunes a **DistilBERT** (`distilbert-base-cased`) model to classify Goodreads book reviews into 8 genres: *poetry, children, comics & graphic, fantasy & paranormal, history & biography, mystery/thriller/crime, romance,* and *young adult*. The dataset comes from the [UCSD Book Graph](https://mengtingwan.github.io/data/goodreads.html). For each genre, 10,000 reviews are streamed and 2,000 are randomly sampled; then 1,000 per genre are used (800 train / 200 test), giving 6,400 training and 1,600 test samples. Training was performed on a **Kaggle Notebook** with GPU acceleration enabled. Experiment tracking was managed using **Weights & Biases (W&B)** (`report_to="wandb"`), and the trained model was uploaded publicly to **Hugging Face Hub**.

## Setup Instructions

The primary training was done in the Kaggle Notebook (linked below). The Python scripts below are extracted from the notebook for standalone use.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ShrikrishnaIITJ/mlops-assignment2.git

# 2. Open the project folder
cd mlops-assignment2

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Set environment variables for API keys
export WANDB_API_KEY="your_wandb_api_key"
export HF_TOKEN="your_huggingface_token"

# 5. Run training
python train.py

# 6. Run evaluation
python evaluate.py

# 7. Run inference
python inference.py --text "A thrilling mystery with unexpected twists and a dark ending."
```

## Training Platform

Training was performed on **Kaggle Notebook** with GPU accelerator.  
Kaggle Secrets were used to securely store `WANDB_API_KEY` and `HF_TOKEN` using `kaggle_secrets.UserSecretsClient`.
